# Welcome to the Z-APP

## Why

- **Problem Statement:**
    - Everything built for Z’s are old. The available apps/software for connecting to the ECUs in the cars are old and dated, missing functionalities and should be FREE at this point.
- **Solution**:
    - To create a modern solution for diagnostics, logging, community, and more. All open-source and should hopefully get some help coming in.
    Target Audience: Nissan Z owners, more specifically: 300zx owners (maybe ODB2 vehicles too).
- **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**
    - Every software for these cars is paid. Stop paying for software from the 90s. It should be free at this point, and this will bring value to the car community as well as interest in keeping old cars alive, by simplifying old tech with today’s standards.

## Features

Feature 1: Connect to ECU for data reading

Feature 2: Maintance Logs - Keep your car's documentation up to date

Feature 3: TBA
